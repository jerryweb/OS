I. Requirements:
    Part 1/2: Implement virtual memory in nachos, using TLB and swap file, and random and FIFO page replacement policies. Show that multiple large programs in different threads and/or processes run to completion correctly using the virtual memory.
    Part 3: Implement remote procedure calls for locks, condition variables, and monitor variables.

II. Assumptions:
	

III. Design:
- This section is to cover your logic and ideas as to how  you are going to solve the problem presented.  This should include a description of classes, algorithms, etc.

IV. Implementation:
	+ Files Modified
        Part 1/2:
            code/userprog/
                addrspace.h/.cc
                exception.cc
                
	+ Files added
        Part 1/2:
            code/userprog/
                translateexec.h
                translateipt.h
                
        
	+ Data Structures added, and the file they were added to.
	+ Data Structures modified, and the file they were added to.
		-For example,
			class Lock		-- in file threads.cc/threads.h
			{
				//. Modified fields.
			}

	+ Functions added and in which file.
	+ Functions modified and in which file.

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
	+ How to test
- How to run the test cases, the commands, the arguments and so on.
	+ Test Output
- Describe the testing output. You don't have to dump all the output info. Just make sure your description can exactly reflect your output.

VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
	+ Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)
	+ Explanation
		- Explain your experiment result.

VIII. Miscellaneous:
- Whatever else you want the grader know about your development.  You can create your own subsections headings here.
