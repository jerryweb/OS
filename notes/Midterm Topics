	Intro to OS 
	- Processes: sharing 
	- Threads //process has multiple execution streams
		sharing issues - race conditions OOEATR (order of execution affects the results) 
							//write this when asked the definition of race condtion
			- mutual exclusion
			- atomic operations -> locks, semaphores, C.V.s // these are all monitors
			* critical section

		memory management
			- virtual memory
			- demand paged virtual memory
			- page replacement
			- swap file

			// know the final flow of the MMU for the exam
		CPU scheduling

	 	* P1: A new airport "employee" 				//write ACTUAL code 
	 	* P2: A syscall
	 		- start.s: tell me about copy/paste 	//example "there are 8 or 9 lines that you need to copy and relable"
	 		- syscall.h 2 things: new syscall # 	//this number should not be used in project 2 in YOUR project
	 							  Func. prototype
	 		- exception handler						//exmaple: here is the case that goes into the switch block, etc. 
	 		- Show a sample user program
