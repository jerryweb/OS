I. Requirements:
    Part 1: Implement locks and condition variables by filling in the empty framework provided. The locks and condion variables must successfully pass the test in the lockTest.cc file. There are 5 tests within that file.
    
    Part 2: Create a multi-threaded airport simulation with the following components:
             - Passengers, who enter the airport with a ticket and luggage and proceed through the simulation until boarding their airplane.
             - Liaisons, who direct passengers to the correct check-in area.
             - Check-in staff, who give passengers boarding passes and process their luggage.
             - Cargo handlers, who transfer processed luggage to their proper airplanes.
             - Screening officers, who check passengers and send them to a security inspector.
             - Security inspectors, who clear passengers checked by the screening officers.
             - A manager, who ensures that all staff are working and allows passengers to board their airplanes at the end of the simulation.

II. Assumptions:
	For the airport simulation:
     - Each airline only has one airplane.
     - Arbitrary upper limit of 6 airlines (requirements state >3).
     - All airlines have the same number of check-in staff.
     - Everyone who keeps track of statistics for the manager does so individually, and the manager polls everyone and adds the results to get the full picture.
     - Passengers are randomly assigned to airlines and given luggage.
     - Passengers will enter a check-in line regardless of whether the staff is on break or not.
     - Each screening officer has a line, and the passenger finds the shortest one.
     - Arbitrary limit of 1-10 screeners and inspectors.
     - The range of passengers for the main simulation is 20 to 100.
     - The range of Airport Liaisons for the main simulaiton is 5 to 7.
     - The range of Check-in Staff for the main simulation is 3 to 5 per airline with a maximum of 15 total.
     - The range of Cargo Handlers is 6 to 10 for the main simulation. 
     - Once initial number of Passengers are created and the Threads are forked at the beginning of the program, no addition passengers can be added to the main simulation.
     - The reason we are mentioning main simulation is due to the special cases for each test.
     - The manager will never go on break during any simulation. 
     - The notes that mentioned that are from class are included in the submission file, however, we will add them to them to this file.
     - When promted to enter a number, the user will enter a positive integer or 0.

III. Design:
- This section is to cover your logic and ideas as to how  you are going to solve the problem presented.  This should include a description of classes, algorithms, etc.

    Part 1: The lock and CV algorithms were given by the professor in class. Locks contain two queues, readyQueue and waitQueue
    - There are only 2 main funtions utilized by the lock class: Acquire and Release. 
    - We added a Size function to the list class, which essentially returns the size of the 

    Part 2: Each component in the airport simulation has its own class; there is also an "Airport" class for public data: these include variables such as states for liaisons, cargo handlers, etc. 

IV. Implementation:
	+ Files Modified - all files are located in the threads directory except for Makefile.common, which is located in the code directory.

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
	+ How to test
        All tests are run from the code/threads folder, using the command "nachos".
        The arguments that correspond with each test are:
         "-T":        Lock and CV test code.
         "-findL":    Passenger selects the shortest line for the airport liaison.
         "-liaison":  Passenger is directed by the Liaison to the correct airline counters.
         "-findCIS":  Economy class passengers enter the shortest line while Executive class passengers enter their correct line.
         "-checkin":  Executive class passengers are given priority over the economy class passengers at the check-in kiosks.
         "-screen":   Screening officer chooses an available security inspector each time a passenger comes in.
         "-cargo":    Cargo handlers choose bags from the conveyor system each time and go on a break if there are no bags.
         "-screen":   Handing over of the hand luggage by the passenger to the screening officer.
         "-inspect":  Passenger returns to the same security inspector after further questioning.
         "-mtest":    Baggage weights of all the passengers of a particular airline should match the weights of the bags reported by the cargo handlers.
         "-inspect":  Handing over of boarding pass by the passenger to the security inspector.
         "-manager":  Hardcoded airport simulation.
         "-airport":  Full airport simulation.
         "-menu":     Menu allowing choice between all tests.
    + Test Output
- Describe the testing output. You don't have to dump all the output info. Just make sure your description can exactly reflect your output.
        

VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
        For PassengerFindsShortestLiaisonLine Test:
            This is the test to show that the passenger chooses the correct line.
            Liaison Queues 0 through 5 are filled with dummy sizes all greater
            than queue 6 to demonstrate passenger finding shortest queue (size 0)
            Adds dummy passengers into the liaison queues:
               line 0: 6
               line 1: 5
               line 2: 4
               line 3: 3
               line 4: 2
               line 5: 1
               line 6: 0
            Sets liaison to busy
              Initializes 1 passenger (id 0) and runs it.
              Intended result:
               Passenger 0 will go to line 6 (length 0).
        
        For LiaisonTest Test
           Adds 1 passengers into liaison 0's queue:
            id 0, ticket.airline 2
           Initializes 1 Liaison thread (id 0) and runs it.
           Intended result:
            The Liaison will direct the passenger to airline 2.

        For CheckInTest
           Adds 3 passengers into the airline 0 check-in queue:
            id 0, executive (line 0)
            id 1, economy (line 1)
            id 2, economy (line 1)
           Initializes 1 CIS thread (id 1; airline 0) and runs it.
           Intended result:
            The CIS will choose to help the executive passenger.
            The economy line will stay at length 2.
	
        For CargoTest
           Adds 7 bags onto the conveyor:
            airline 0, weight 30
            airline 1, weight 42
            airline 2, weight 54
            airline 0, weight 30
            airline 1, weight 45
            airline 0, weight 45
            airline 1, weight 60
           Initializes 6 cargo (0-5) threads and runs them.
           Intended result:
            The bags will be added to the proper airplane in the
             order in which they were added to the conveyor.
             After all bags are finished, the cargo handlers
             will all go on break.

        For AirportSim
            This should simulate the entire airport running from start to finish as mentioned in the guidlines. 

    + Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)
        For PassengerFindsShortestLiaisonLine Test, LiaisonTest Test, CheckInTest, and CargoTest all generate the correct output that is listed above in the experiment expectation.
