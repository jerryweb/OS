     - Each airline only has one airplane.
     - All airlines have the same number of check-in staff.
     - Everyone who keeps track of statistics for the manager does so individually, and the manager polls everyone and adds the results to get the full picture.
     - Passengers are randomly assigned to airlines and given luggage.

IV. Implementation:
	+ Files Modified
	+ Files added

	+ Data Structures added, and the file they were added to.
	+ Data Structures modified, and the file they were added to.
		-For example,
			class Lock		-- in file threads.cc/threads.h
			{
				//. Modified fields.
			}

	+ Functions added and in which file.
	+ Functions modified and in which file.

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
	+ How to test
- How to run the test cases, the commands, the arguments and so on.
	+ Test Output
- Describe the testing output. You don't have to dump all the output info. Just make sure your description can exactly reflect your output.

VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
	+ Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)
	+ Explanation
		- Explain your experiment result.

VIII. Miscellaneous:
- Whatever else you want the grader know about your development.  You can create your own subsections headings here.
