I. Requirements:
    Part 1: Implement locks and condition variables by filling in the empty framework provided. The locks and condition variables must successfully pass the test in the lockTest.cc file. There are 5 tests within that file.
    
    Part 2: Create a multi-threaded airport simulation with the following components:
             - Passengers, who enter the airport with a ticket and luggage and proceed through the simulation until boarding their airplane.
             - Liaisons, who direct passengers to the correct check-in area.
             - Check-in staff, who give passengers boarding passes and process their luggage.
             - Cargo handlers, who transfer processed luggage to their proper airplanes.
             - Screening officers, who check passengers and send them to a security inspector.
             - Security inspectors, who clear passengers checked by the screening officers.
             - A manager, who ensures that all staff are working and allows passengers to board their airplanes at the end of the simulation.

II. Assumptions:
	For the airport simulation:
     - Each airline only has one airplane.
     - Arbitrary upper limit of 6 airlines (requirements state >3).
     - All airlines have the same number of check-in staff.
     - Everyone who keeps track of statistics for the manager does so individually, and the manager polls everyone and adds the results to get the full picture.
     - Passengers are randomly assigned to airlines and given luggage.
     - Passengers will enter a check-in line regardless of whether the staff is on break or not.
     - Each screening officer has a line, and the passenger finds the shortest one.
     - Arbitrary limit of 1-10 screeners and inspectors.
     - The range of passengers for the main simulation is 20 to 100.
     - The range of Airport Liaisons for the main simulation is 5 to 7.
     - The range of Check-in Staff for the main simulation is 3 to 5 per airline with a maximum of 15 total.
     - The range of Cargo Handlers is 6 to 10 for the main simulation. 
     - Once initial number of Passengers are created and the Threads are forked at the beginning of the program, no addition passengers can be added to the main simulation.
     - The reason we are mentioning main simulation is due to the special cases for each test.
     - The manager will never go on break during any simulation.
     - When prompted to enter a number, the user will enter a positive integer or 0.

III. Design:
- This section is to cover your logic and ideas as to how  you are going to solve the problem presented.  This should include a description of classes, algorithms, etc.

    Part 1: 
    - Locks contain two queues, readyQueue and waitQueue, and a state which can be BUSY or FREE. There are 2 main functions utilized by the lock class: Acquire and Release. When a lock is acquired by a thread, only that specific thread is able to use the CPU and run its critical section. Once the critical section is completed, the thread releases the lock.
        acquire()
        {
            disable interrupts
            if current thread owns lock, restore interrupts and return
            if lock is FREE, make lock BUSY and make self owner
            else, add self to lock wait queue and sleep
            restore interrupts
        }
        release()
        {
            disable interrupts
            if current thread does not own lock, print error message, restore interrupts and return
            if there is a thread waiting, remove a thread from wait queue, call scheduler->ReadyToRun on that thread, and make them lock owner
            else, make lock FREE and set lock owner to NULL
            restore interrupts
        }
    - The CV class has 3 functions (Wait, Signal, and Broadcast; each takes in a lock), a waitList, and a waitLock. When a thread waits on a CV, it adds itself to the CV's wait list and goes to sleep. Another thread can wake a sleeping thread by signalling the first thread in the wait list or broadcasting to wake all threads in the list.
        wait
        {
            disable interrupts
            if passed-in lock is not valid, print error, restore interrupts, return
            if wait lock is null (first thread to call wait), use passed-in lock as wait lock
            if wait lock is not the same as passed-in lock, print error, restore interrupts, return
            release passed-in lock
            add self to CV wait queue and go to sleep
            restore interrupts
        }
        signal
        {
            disable interrupts
            if no waiting threads, restore interrupts and return
            if wait lock is not the same as passed-in lock, print error, restore interrupts, return
            remove one thread from CV wait queue, run scheduler->ReadyToRun for that thread
            if no more waiting threads, set wait lock to null
            restore interrupts
        }
        broadcast
        {
            if wait lock is not the same as passed-in lock, print error and return
            while there are still waiting threads, signal using the passed-in lock
        }
    - We added a Size() function to the list class, which essentially returns the size of the the list. This is allowed all functions that counted or accessed the array and lists of functions throughout the code to be dynamic and avoid looking outside of the bounds of the list. We also added a First() function, which returns the first element of the list without removing it.

    Part 2: Each component (passenger, liaison, CIS, etc.) in the airport simulation has its own class; there is also an "Airport" class for public data: these include variables such as locks, lists, and states for liaisons, cargo handlers, etc. At the start of the simulation, all the liaisons should be set to the Busy state so that the passengers will automatically enter their lines. All the passengers should be forked first, followed by liaisons, then check-in staff and cargo handlers, then screening and security officers and finally the manager. 
    
        Passenger:
            // liaison interaction
            acquire liaisonLineLock
            find shortest line, add self to line
            if liaison l is BUSY, wait on liaisonLineCV (using liaisonLineLock)
            else, release liaisonLineLock
            acquire liaison's liaisonLock
            signal liaison's liaisonCV (using liaison's liaisonLock) // simulates giving liaison information
            release liaison's liaisonLock // allows liaison to give information
            // check-in interaction
            acquire airline's checkinLineLock
            if ticket is executive, go to executive line
            else, find the shortest economy line
            add self to line
            wait on line's checkinLineCV (using airline's checkinLineLock) // allows check-in staff to give information
            (acquire airline's checkinLineLock)
            (print statement)
            (release airline's checkinLineLock)

                    remove passenger from queue
                    set state to BUSY
                    give passenger counter data
                else, set state to FREE
            acquire liaison's liaisonLock
            release liaisonLineLock
            if the liaison is helping a customer:
                wait on liaison's liaisonCV (using liaison's liaisonLock) // wait for passenger to acknowledge
                acquire liaison's liaisonLock
                record passenger statistics
                release liaison's liaisonLock
            else, wait on liaison's liaisonCV (using liaison's liaisonLock) // wait for passenger to show up)
            if the manager is requesting data from the liaison:
                acquire liaisonManagerLock

                release liaisonManagerLock

                confirm message sent
        
        CheckIn (main loop):
            acquire airline's checkinLineLock
            if the staff is not CLOSED, get the next passenger to help:
                if the executive line is not empty, take the next passenger in the line
                else if the staff's economy line is not empty, take the next passenger in the staff's line
                else:
                    acquire staff's checkinLock
                    set state to BREAK

    + Test Output
        See Discussion/Experiment expectation and the output guidelines - the tests
         do not introduce any new outputs, and the expected results are described
         under "Intended result:".

VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
        For PassengerFindsShortestLiaisonLine Test:
            This is the test to show that the passenger chooses the correct line.
            Liaison Queues 0 through 5 are filled with dummy sizes all greater
            than queue 6 to demonstrate passenger finding shortest queue (size 0)
            Adds dummy passengers into the liaison queues:
               line 0: 6
               line 1: 5
               line 2: 4
               line 3: 3
               line 4: 2
               line 5: 1
               line 6: 0
            Sets liaison to busy
              Initializes 1 passenger (id 0) and runs it.
              Intended result:
               Passenger 0 will go to line 6 (length 0).
        
        For LiaisonTest Test
           Adds 1 passengers into liaison 0's queue:
            id 0, ticket.airline 2
           Initializes 1 Liaison thread (id 0) and runs it.
           Intended result:
            The Liaison will direct the passenger to airline 2.

        For CheckInTest
           Adds 3 passengers into the airline 0 check-in queue:
            id 0, executive (line 0)
            id 1, economy (line 1)
            id 2, economy (line 1)
           Initializes 1 CIS thread (id 1; airline 0) and runs it.
           Intended result:
            The CIS will choose to help the executive passenger.
            The economy line will stay at length 2.
	
        For CargoTest
           Adds 7 bags onto the conveyor:
            airline 0, weight 30
            airline 1, weight 42
            airline 2, weight 54
            airline 0, weight 30
            airline 1, weight 45
            airline 0, weight 45
            airline 1, weight 60
           Initializes 6 cargo (0-5) threads and runs them.
           Intended result:
            The bags will be added to the proper airplane in the
             order in which they were added to the conveyor.
             After all bags are finished, the cargo handlers
             will all go on break.
             
        For ScreenTest
        	Adds 10 passengers to the screening queues with the following pattern:
        	screen queue 1: P0,P1,P2,P3
        	screen queue 2: P4,P5,P6
        	screen queue 3: P7,P8,P9
        	
        	Adds 6 dummy passengers to the security queues with the following pattern:
        	security queue 1: size 1
        	security queue 2: size 2
        	security queue 3: size 3
        	
        	Initialize 10 Passenger threads
        	Initialize 3 ScreenOfficer threads
        	Run all these threads
        	Intended Result:
        	security queue 0: dummy,P0,P1,P3
        	security queue 1: dummy,dummy,P2,P4
        	security queue 2: dummy,dummy,dummy,P5
        	
        For InspectTest
        	Create then add 5 passengers to one security queue
        	Create 1 security inspector at this security queue
        	The passengers will all finish checking, some goes to return line but eventually
        	they will all be allowed to aboard	
        	    

        For AirportSim
            This should simulate the entire airport running from start to finish as mentioned in the guidelines. 

    + Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)
        For PassengerFindsShortestLiaisonLine Test, LiaisonTest Test, CheckInTest, and CargoTest all generate the correct output that is listed above in the experiment expectation.

        A final boarding call and confirmation to the manager that all passengers have boarded would eliminate this problem because the final call would only allow the manager to gather data from all parties one last time before displaying the data at the end. Instead the simulation will run in an infinite loop, as the manager will keep asking for data. 
        


	+ Explanation
        As mentioned in the previous section, our simulation will not completely finish due to the fact that the two portions (screening officer and passenger interaction along with manager screening officer interaction and once the passenger is directed to the gate) are not connect. All of these functions, however, do work separately within different tests. All functions not concerning the security officer and screening officer will work in one simulation including the collection of data by the manager from check-in staff, liaisons, and cargo handlers. However due to the inability of the passengers to fully board the plane, the output will not show the correct values. This is due to this specific loop:
            for(int i = 0; i < airport->numAirlines; i++){ 
                liaisonPassengerCount[i] = 0;
                liaisonBaggageCount[i] = 0;
            }

            and

            for(int i = 0; i < airport->numAirlines; i++){       
                checkinPassengerCount[i] = 0;
                checkinBaggageWeight[i] = 0;
            }
            '
            and
            
            for(int i = 0; i < airport->numAirlines; i++){
                cargoHandlersBaggageCount[i] = 0;
                cargoHandlersBaggageWeight[i] = 0;
            }.

        These functions prevent double and multi-counting of data when the manager requests data from each thread. A final boarding call and confirmation to the manager that all passengers have boarded would eliminate this problem because the final call would only allow the manager to gather data from all parties one last time before displaying the data at the end. Instead the simulation will run in an infinite loop, as the manager will keep asking for data. 


VIII. Miscellaneous:

The Putty terminal locked us out when we were testing our simulation due to us exceeding the process limit. We were sent an email by ITS explaining what had happed:

Our computing policies were instituted to help maximize the resources
available to our user community.  We expect you to act responsibly and
with consideration to others.  Please do not run more than 20 processes
at one time on the SCF timesharing hosts.  You may want to check for and
kill old processes if you are disconnected, using
        /usr/ucb/ps aux | grep jerryweb   ; kill PID
as you may have processes from several old login sessions.

As outlined in our policies, this message registers a warning.
