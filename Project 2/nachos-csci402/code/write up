I. Requirements:
    Implement syscalls:
        Fork: create and run a new thread.
        Exec: create and run a new process.
        Exit: exit the current thread and clean up memory.
        Yield: yield the current thread.
        CreateLock: create a lock stored in the kernel.
        Acquire: acquire a lock stored in the kernel.
        Release: release a lock stored in the kernel.
        DestroyLock: destroy a lock stored in the kernel.
        CreateCondition: create a condition stored in the kernel.
        Wait: wait on a condition stored in the kernel.
        Signal: signal a condition stored in the kernel.
        Broadcast: broadcast on a condition stored in the kernel.
        DestroyCondition: destroy a condition stored in the kernel.
        Printf: print a given string and int parameters to the console.
    Write tests to make sure these syscalls work as intended, both positive and negative.
    Convert the airport from project 1 to use the syscalls and run a test where at least two instances run concurrently.

II. Assumptions:
	The application programmer can count (i.e. they always supply the correct number of characters when passing in a char* string in via syscall).
    Syscalls are always called with the correct type (e.g. no trying to input a char* for a syscall which takes in an int); this should mostly be taken care of by the compiler, but spurious typecasting may or may not be weeded out by error cases depending on the value.

III. Design:
        Fork:
            If the function pointer is null, return. (No way to check for other types of invalid.)
            Read the name in; return if invalid.
            Create a new thread, and set its process to the current process.
            Update the process's thread table.
            Fork the kernel function for the thread:
                Set the program counter of the machine to the function pointer.
                Set the stack register of the machine to the new thread's stack.
                Run the thread.
        Exec:
            Read the filename in; return -1 if invalid.
            Open the file; return -1 if invalid.
            Create a new process with the file handle and a new kernel thread for that process.
            Fork the kernel thread: 
                Initialize registers and run.
            Return the id of the new process (set in the address space constructor).
        Yield:
            Yield the current thread.
        Exit:
            Acquire the process table's lock.
            Get the current process.
            Acquire the current process's thread table's lock.
            Get the current thread's stack location.
            If the process is not the last process:
                If the thread is the last thread in the process:
                    Acquire the lock table's lock.
                    For each lock in the table: if it belongs to the process, destroy it (releasing the lock table's lock in the process), and reacquire the lock table's lock.
                    Release the lock table's lock.
                    Acquire the CV table's lock.
                    For each condition in the table: if it belongs to the process, destroy it (releasing the CV table's lock in the process), and reacquire the CV table's lock.
                    Release the CV table's lock.
                    Clear the process's pages.
                    Remove the process from the process table (releasing the process table's lock in the process).
                Else (if the thread is not the last in the process):
                    Release the process table's lock.
                    Clear the thread's pages.
                Remove the current thread from the process's thread table (releasing the thread table's lock in the process).
                Call finish on the thread.
            Else (if the process is the last process):
                If the thread is the last thread in the process:
                    Acquire the lock table's lock.
                    For each lock in the table: if it belongs to the process, destroy it (releasing the lock table's lock in the process), and reacquire the lock table's lock.
                    Release the lock table's lock.
                    Acquire the CV table's lock.
                    For each condition in the table: if it belongs to the process, destroy it (releasing the CV table's lock in the process), and reacquire the CV table's lock.

                    Clear the process's pages.
                    Remove the process from the process table (releasing the process table's lock in the process).
                    Halt nachos.
                Else (if the thread is not the last in the process):
                    Release the process table's lock.
                    Clear the thread's pages.
                    Remove the current thread from the process's thread table (releasing the thread table's lock in the process).

IV. Implementation:

    The structs/enums/functions/whatever else from the .c test files are not included in the sections below, because they're functionally the same from project 1.

        nachos -x ../test/lockTest -d z
        nachos -x ../test/condTest -d z

    + Test Output
        I just dumped the full output out of laziness. The final test output may differ, depending on whether we decide to keep or take out (or even add) print statements in the final version.

        airportTest:
            Two sets of standard airport outputs, hopefully (see output guidelines from first project).
            
VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
        forkTest:
            First, passes in an invalid function pointer, which fails to fork; then, forks two threads which simply print and exit.
        execTest:
            First, execs testfiles (which tests the file system syscalls), then passes in an invalid file name, which fails to exec. (The failed exec should print before testfiles runs.)
        exitTest:
            Forks a simple print thread, then execs a process (running testfiles). The main thread exits first (>1 process left, >1 thread left), then the forked thread (>1 process left, 1 thread left), then the other process's main thread (1 process left, 1 thread left). 
        lockTest:
            Part 1: Tests the ID failure conditions. Creates a lock with invalid name, which returns -1 for index. Then, tries to use invalid ids -1 and 1 for the calls, which won't work. Then, creates a good lock and tests all calls. Once the lock is deleted, tries to do calls on the again, which fails.
            Part 2: Tests the lock over two threads. Creates a lock, then forks a thread. That thread will acquire, then yield; the main thread will acquire (but not be able to), then the other thread will release, call destroy (which won't do anything but print), and exit. The main thread then releases and destroys.
            Part 3: Tests the lock over two processes. Creates a lock, then execs a process which tries to do syscalls on the first process's lock (which won't work), then exits. The main thread exits, which calls destroy on the lock automatically.
        condTest:
            Part 1: Tests the ID failure conditions. Creates a condition with invalid name, which returns -1 for index. Then, tries to use invalid ids -1 and 1 for the calls, which won't work. Then, creates a good condition and tests all calls with a bad lock, which will work but print an error from the Condition class.
            Part 2: Tests the condition over two threads, using the condition from the previous part. Forks a new thread, then waits on the condition. The new thread tries to call destroy, which doesn't do anything, then signals the condition, waking the main thread up, then waits on the condition. Then, the main thread forks another thread and waits; the second new thread tries to call destroy, which doesn't do anything, then broadcasts, waking both of the other threads up. Both new threads then exit, and the main thread destroys the condition, then tries to do all calls on it again, which fails.
            Part 3: Tests the condition over two processes. Creates a condition, then execs a process which tries to do syscalls on the first process's condition (which won't work), then exits. The main thread exits, which calls destroy on the condition automatically.
        airportTest:
            Execs two airportSim processes, which run a cut-down version of the airport from project 1 with fixed numbers: 3 airlines, 21 passengers (7 per airline), 3 bags per passenger, each 30 lbs, 5 liaisons, 3 check-ins per airline (for a total of 9), 6 cargo handlers, 3 screening officers and security inspectors, and 1 manager.

    + Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)
        All individual tests work as expected.
        airportTest...does not.
