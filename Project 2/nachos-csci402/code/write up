I. Requirements:
    Implement syscalls:
        Fork: create and run a new thread.
        Exec: create and run a new process.
        Exit: exit the current thread and clean up memory.
        Yield: yield the current thread.
        CreateLock: create a lock stored in the kernel.
        Acquire: acquire a lock stored in the kernel.
        Release: release a lock stored in the kernel.
        DestroyLock: destroy a lock stored in the kernel.
        CreateCondition: create a condition stored in the kernel.
        Wait: wait on a condition stored in the kernel.
        Signal: signal a condition stored in the kernel.
        Broadcast: broadcast on a condition stored in the kernel.
        DestroyCondition: destroy a condition stored in the kernel.
        Printf: print a given string and int parameters to the console.
    Write tests to make sure these syscalls work as intended, both positive and negative.
    Convert the airport from project 1 to use the syscalls and run a test where at least two instances run concurrently.
